HTTP/1.1:

1.This version relies on a series of sequential requests and responses. Each request requires its connection, leading to head-of-line blocking and inefficiency.

2.Headers are sent in plaintext with each request, resulting in unnecessary overhead and larger data transfer.

3.Uses a text-based protocol, which is human-readable but less efficient for computers to parse.

4.Lacks the ability for the server to push resources to the client without explicit requests, leading to additional latency in fetching required assets.

5.Encryption (HTTPS) is optional, which can pose security risks and hinder user privacy.

HTTP/2:

1.Header compression is a feature of HTTP/2 that reduces redundancy in headers, saving bandwidth and improving performance.

2.Adopts a binary protocol, making it more machine-friendly and quicker to process.

3.Supports server push, allowing servers to preemptively send assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript, reducing page load times.

4.Encourages the use of encryption through TLS, enhancing security and user data protection.
